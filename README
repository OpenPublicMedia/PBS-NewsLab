Right now, this is just a teaser file.  Soon, this file will itemize various tools and templates that are available for the public.

First up -- we're working on a tool called ColorTheStates that'll make it easier to generate background KML files that outline state(s) you'd like to highlight on a Google map.  This may include a KML color converter.

As of now, you'll find it in the repo, but we're still tweaking it.  Feel free to play with this basic Django app. When you find bugs, please email Michelle at meminkoff@pbs.org.
